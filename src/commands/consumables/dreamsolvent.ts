If someone dreamed of heaven before waking up clutching a flower, then that blossom must have been made from such a fantasy. Dream Solvent dissolves that which is obtained from memory and transforms it into some other dream.\nIndeed, blows traded with the strong are stepping stones towards becoming stronger yourself."
